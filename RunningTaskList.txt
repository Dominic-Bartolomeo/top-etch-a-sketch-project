HTML:
*    - Create container div
*    - Create Button

JS:
*    - Take button input
*    - Use Onclick for button to run JS function/script
*    - Create grid of input * input dimensions
*    - Attach eventlistener to button
*    - Grid is created with the same space
*    - Maximum number of grid l || w is 100
!    - Delete existing grid every time button is clicked.

CSS:
*    - Set grid to flex
*        - wrap the grid
*    - Confine grid to certain area (960px wide) 


MISC (Not sure where to put yet):
    - Hover effect on grid

Thinking:

Make input amount of rows of columns. Hence why we only need to calc width.

Need to see if the grid exists. IF it does, delete it. If it doesn't move on.

    Make a check grid variable
    set it to false
    if grid exists get rid of the children
    otherwise run create grid
